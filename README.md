# Udacity-Analyst-Nanodegree-Program
This repository is about my udacity nanodegree course projects

## p1 Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
  * [Instruction for this project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OkpZLjG_kX9J6LIQ5IltsqMzVWjh36QpnP2RYpVdPU/pub?embedded=True)
  
## p2 Investigate a Titanic Dataset
  *Project Overview*
  In this project, I will use Numpy and Pandas Python package to do a simple data analysis with Kaggle's Titantic dataset.
  * [Template code for this project](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002/parts/0021345403/modules/317671873575461/lessons/3176718735239847/concepts/642ab657-197e-4beb-afd6-4494e6da490b)
  
## p3 Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
  *Project Overview*
  In this project, I will choose any area of the world in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that my care about. Finally, I will choose either MongoDB or SQL as the data schema to complete my project.

## p4 Exploratory Data Analysis with R
  *Project Overview*
  In this project, I will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.
  
## p5 Identify Fraud from Enron Email
  *Project Overview*
  In this project, I will play detective, and put my machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.
  
## p6 Make Effective Data Visualization
  *Project Overview*
  In this project, I will create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. I will need to use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization.The work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
